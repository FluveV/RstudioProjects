# RstudioProjects
This is more of a performative post, as it collects the most useful exercises and lectures I had in the first year of my Master's degree, ranging from:

- Data Visualization, taught by Jurman and Chierici

- Statistical Learning, taught by Vinciotti and Chierici

- Advanced Social Networks, taught by Agneessens.
